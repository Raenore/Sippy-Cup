## [0.1.1] - 2025-06-xx

### Added
- Added an option to display consumable popups only when you are flagged as “In Character” by an MSP-compatible roleplay addon (e.g., TRP, MRP, XRP). (see [#17](https://github.com/Raenore/Sippy-Cup/pull/17))

### Fixed
- Logout through Main Menu, /camp, /logout, etc. would error when a Sippy Cup popup was present (fixed in [#13](https://github.com/Raenore/Sippy-Cup/pull/13)).
- Pause MisMatch timer check during loading screens which avoids fake removals on teleports (fixed in [#14](https://github.com/Raenore/Sippy-Cup/pull/14)).

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-31
