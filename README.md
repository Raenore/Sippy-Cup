# Sippy Cup ü•§

**Sippy Cup** tracks and reminds you of your roleplay consumables, helping keep you focused on what matters most: *Roleplay*.  
Available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sippy-cup), [Wago.io](https://addons.wago.io/addons/sippy-cup) and [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26933-SippyCup.html)!  

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Once enabled, Sippy Cup will display a reminder popup when:
- Your consumable runs out (or is about to, if that option is enabled).  
- Your current stack count falls below your desired amount.  
- You lack the necessary item(s) for your next refresh.

  </tr>
</table>

**Note:** On login, a popup will appear for tracked consumables with active stacks. If the **Only when "In Character"** option is enabled, it will also remind you about inactive stacks.

If multiple consumables expire simultaneously, Sippy Cup will display multiple popups.  
Once you have 5 popups active, additional ones will be queued and shown as you dismiss or resolve existing ones.

  </tr>
</table>

If an item cannot be refreshed because it‚Äôs either missing from your inventory or you don‚Äôt have enough units or stacks to reach your desired amount, the refresh button will display a warning-colored tooltip.

  </tr>
</table>

If the **Insufficient Reminder** option is enabled (disabled by default), Sippy Cup will remind you if you don't have enough of the item for your next refresh.

## ‚öôÔ∏è General Settings

Adjust Sippy Cup's settings to match your personal preferences by using `/sc` or `/sippycup`.

Here you can:  
- Toggle a **Startup message** at login.  
- Control the visibility of the **Minimap button**.  
- Configure integration with the **Addon compartment** of UI mods.

The **Reminder Popups** section offers detailed control over how reminders appear:  
- **Pre-expiration Reminder** to notify you before items expire (only for supported consumables).  
- **Insufficient Reminder** to alert you when you don‚Äôt have enough items for the next refresh.  
- **Customize their position** on the screen (Top, Center, or Bottom).  
- Choose a **sound** for reminders and decide if they should **flash your taskbar**.

Sippy Cup also offers special integration:  
- **Only when "In Character"**: Limits Sippy Cup's checks and reminders to times when your character is recognized as "In Character".  
  (Requires an RP profile addon like TRP3, MRP, XRP, etc.)
