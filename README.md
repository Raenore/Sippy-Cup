# Sippy Cup ü•§

**Sippy Cup** tracks and reminds you of your roleplay consumables, helping keep you focused on what matters most: *Roleplay*.  
Available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sippy-cup), [Wago.io](https://addons.wago.io/addons/sippy-cup) and [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26933-SippyCup.html)!  

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Once enabled, Sippy Cup will display a reminder popup when:
- Your consumable runs out (or is about to if enabled).
- Your current stack count falls below your desired amount.

    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8IKpY0y.png" alt="Popup Icon"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Note:** To minimize login popups, only active consumables with stack counts below your desired amount will display reminders on login (unless you in "In Character" with the RP Profile addon option enabled).

If multiple consumables expire simultaneously, Sippy Cup will display multiple popups.
Due to WoW's limit of four simultaneous pop-ups, the oldest reminder will be dismissed if a fifth one appears.

  </tr>
</table>

If an item cannot be refreshed because it's either absent from your inventory or you don't have enough units/stacks to reach your desired amount, the refresh button will display a warning-colored tooltip.

  </tr>
</table>

## ‚öôÔ∏è General Settings

Adjust Sippy Cup's settings to match your personal preferences.

Here you can:  
- Toggle a **Startup message** at login.
- Control the visibility of the **Minimap button**.
- Configure integration with the **Addon compartment** of UI mods.

The "Reminder Popups" section offers detailed control over how reminders appear:  
- **Customize their position** on screen.
- Enable **pre-expiration reminders** to fire a reminder before they expire (only for supported consumables).
- Choose a **sound** for reminders and decide if they should **flash your taskbar**.

Sippy Cup also offers special integration:  
- **Only when "In Character"**: Limits Sippy Cup's checks and reminders to only when your character is recognized as "In Character".  
(Requires an RP Profile addon like TRP3, MRP, XRP, etc.)
